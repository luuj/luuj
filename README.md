Hi, my name is Jonathan and I am currently a 4th year student at Harvard University studying Biostatistics.
- My research interests lie in clustered semi-continuous methodology. I am working with Sebastien Haneuse to implement a novel model that incorporates competing risks.
- I have experience in a variety of programming languages including C++, Java, Python, R, Stata, and SAS. I am currently learning Stan to improve my Bayesian model's efficiency.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve clinical trials, nursing homes, and survival analysis.
